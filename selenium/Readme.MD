## Selenium Run

To run Selenium, follow these steps:

1. Ensure you have the latest Chrome driver. Download it first and then upload it to the Selenium scraping folder.

2. Run the following command to install the required dependencies:

    ```
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

3. Execute the Python script `first.py`:

    ```
    python first.py
    ```

Make sure to replace `[create if not exists]` with instructions to create the `requirements.txt` file if it doesn't exist.
